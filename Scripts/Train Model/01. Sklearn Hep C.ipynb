    "- **Makes Things Flexible**: By putting our model in this special box, we can quickly change how it works without affecting the rest of our code. If we want to use a different model or make a different prediction, we can do so easily.\n",

    "The `SklearnModelWrapper` class is like a special adapter for our machine learning model. It allows us to use the model with MLflow and gives us the freedom to customize how the model makes predictions. It's a handy tool that makes our code more flexible and easier to manage."
